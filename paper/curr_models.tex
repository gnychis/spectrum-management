Graph coloring~\cite{utilfair,unified},  weighted coloring~\cite{weighted}, simulated annealing~\cite{taw are}, adaptive/greedy~\cite{whitefi,ding}, and even adapting genetic algorithms~\cite{ding}.

\subsection{Limitations of Current Models}

Going back to our requirements, what these models don't account for
